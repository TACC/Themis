Here are some questions about making rtm work w/python.

* How to do capture?
** TermWidth
** stdout, stderr connected to a terminal?

* Factory
I seem to remember something about using apply as part of a factory.

* funcTbl:
  the JobSubmit object has to be callable via strings.  In other
  words, functions in Job like CWD and submit, have to be callable
  from inside runscript.

* @staticmethod
   What is up with this?
